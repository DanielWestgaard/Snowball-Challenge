          World Animal Protection</a> describes this the best: "Plastic waste is littering our oceans and threatening the
        lives of millions of marine animals. Seals, whales, dolphins, seabirds, fish, crabs and many other sea
        animals are dying and becoming sick because of this deadly environmental concern".</p>
      <p>They continues to describe
        the danger behind this littering: "Sea animals often eat microplastics because of their small size. And
        plastic contains toxic chemicals, which can increase the chance of disease and affect reproduction. After
        ingesting microplastics, seals, and other animals, may suffer for months or years before they die.
        In 2014, an estimated 15 to 51 trillion microplastic particles were floating in the world’s oceans,
        weighing between 93,000 and 236,000 tonnes."</p>

      <p>The app is simple to understand. You pick up garbage by the sea and you get points for every piece of garbage. The top 500 users get rewards like coupons, movie tickets, etc. However, this system would be easy to exploit and difficult to track. So, the solution we came up with was an event-based system. One day every month there will be events all over the world where you meet up and collect garbage. At the end of the day you count all the garbage you picked up and the overseer for that event will check the results. The app will serve as an event-finder and it will find the nearest event and the time for that event. You check inn with the app and then you can participate. We hope you will get motivated by this system so you will pick up more garbage.</p>

      <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
      <p>The reason we wanted to create this app was to help the world, the oceans and the animals living there.
        We see daily litter and garbage floating around in the oceans, just waiting to hurt the ecosystem or
        another animal.</p>
      <p>That's why we created the app. Because we also knew that this is something we couldn't do alone. So
        we created this app! In order for others to help in the fight for animals to swim in cleaner waters again.
        As well as helping the oceans, we're also awarding the people that works the hardest. This way everyone
        will win!</p>
